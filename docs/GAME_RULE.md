# 🎭 Game Rules: Undercover (Indonesian Party Game)

## 🧩 Overview

**Undercover** is a fun offline social deduction game where each player is given a secret word. Most players receive the **same word** (Civilians), one or two get a **slightly different word** (Undercover), and optionally, one player gets **no word at all** — they are **Mr. White**.

The game is about giving vague clues, identifying impostors, and bluffing your way to survival.

## 👥 Roles

- **Civilians**  
  Receive the same word (e.g., `"Cat"`).  
  Work together to find the Undercover(s) and Mr. White.

- **Undercover**  
  Receive a similar but different word (e.g., `"Dog"`).  
  Their goal is to **blend in** and eliminate Civilians.

- **Mr. White** (optional role)  
  Receives **no word at all**.  
  Mr. White must **pretend to know the word** by guessing based on others' clues.

## 🔄 Game Stages

1. **Word Assignment**  
   The app gives each player their secret word — except Mr. White, who sees a blank screen.

2. **Description Round**  
   Each player, in turn, **gives a one-sentence clue** about their word.  
   Clues must not mention the word directly or use obvious synonyms.

3. **Voting Round**  
   Players vote on who they suspect. The one with the most votes is eliminated.

4. **Repeat**  
   Repeat clues and voting each round until a win condition is met.

## 🎮 Gameplay Rules

- Clues must be subtle, clever, and honest — but not too obvious.
- You may not show your word or give gestures.
- Mr. White must **improvise** based only on others' descriptions.
- Civilians should be strategic in giving clues — helpful to teammates, vague to Undercover.
- Undercover should **fake their clue** carefully to blend in.

## 🏆 Win Conditions

- ✅ **Civilians win** if all Undercover players **and Mr. White** are eliminated.
- ✅ **Undercover wins** if they survive until only 2 players remain (1 Civilian + 1 Undercover).
- ✅ **Mr. White wins** if:
  - They are the **last player standing** (all other players are eliminated), OR
  - When eliminated, they **correctly guess the Civilian word**.
